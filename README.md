# Twitter_Classification
There are two parts to this project.<br>
In the first part different Machine Learning models like KNN Classifier, Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest Classifier are used to predict whether a tweet will go viral.
Features like length of tweet, no. of followers, no. of words, no. of hashtags are used to build the model.<br>
In the second part Naive Baye's classifier is used to predict whether a tweet was sent from New York City, London, or Paris. Investigated how language is used differently in these three cities by learning the tweet vocabulary using CountVectorizer.
